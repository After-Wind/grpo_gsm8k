The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda together is $12 + (P + S). The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda together is $12 + (P + S). According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda together. This means the cost of the super ticket is $2 more than the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda together. We can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 20 = 12 + (P + 3) + 2 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 20 = 12 + P + 3 + 2 \\]\n\\[ 20 = 17 + P \\]\n\nTo find P, we subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ P = 20 - 17 \\]\n\\[ P = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the regular price of popcorn is $3. #### 3",
